ESP32 Water Monitoring System - Version 3
Project Overview
This project is a smart water monitoring system based on the ESP32 microcontroller. It integrates various sensors and components to monitor water parameters and display relevant information on an OLED screen. The system is designed to be efficient, compact, and easily expandable for home or industrial water monitoring applications.

The uploaded photo shows the prototype built on a perforated board, including the ESP32 module, OLED display, LEDs, push buttons, voltage regulators, and other circuit components.

Hardware Components
ESP32 Development Board
Main microcontroller handling data acquisition, processing, and communication.

OLED Display (SSD1306 or similar, I2C)
For displaying real-time sensor readings and system status.

Voltage Regulators
To power the system components reliably from input power source.

LED Indicators
For visual status alerts.

Push Buttons
For user input or system control.

Additional Sensors / Modules (assumed from code and setup)
Could include water level sensors, TDS sensors, temperature sensors, etc.

Miscellaneous Components
Resistors, capacitors, connectors, PCB/perfboard.

Software Features (from the .ino file)
Initialization of sensors and peripherals.

Reading water parameters like water level, temperature, TDS (Total Dissolved Solids).

Displaying sensor data on OLED display.

Possibly connecting to Wi-Fi and sending data to a cloud service (e.g., Firebase, Blynk) [Check code for network features].

Manual and/or automatic control of water pumps or alarms based on sensor thresholds.

Debounce and input reading from buttons.

System status LEDs for user feedback.

Installation & Setup
Hardware Setup
Assemble the components on a perfboard or PCB as shown in the photo.

Connect the OLED display to ESP32’s I2C pins (usually GPIO 21 = SDA, GPIO 22 = SCL).

Connect sensors and actuators as per wiring in the schematic/code comments.

Connect power supply ensuring correct voltage levels.

Software Setup
Install Arduino IDE (latest version recommended).

Install ESP32 board support via Boards Manager.

Install necessary libraries:

Adafruit_SSD1306 or equivalent OLED library

Wire for I2C communication

Any sensor libraries used in your code (check #include directives)

Open the Esp32_water_monitor_V3.ino sketch in Arduino IDE.

Adjust configuration parameters (Wi-Fi SSID, passwords, sensor pins, thresholds) inside the code as necessary.

Compile and upload to the ESP32 board.

Usage
Power the system.

OLED display shows live water monitoring data.

Use buttons for user interaction (mode change, reset, calibration).

Observe LED indicators for system alerts.

Optionally connect to cloud services for remote monitoring (verify in code).

Code Structure Overview
setup() — Initialize components, sensors, Wi-Fi, display.

loop() — Main loop reading sensors, updating display, handling user input.

Functions for sensor reading, display update, network communication.

Interrupt or debounce handling for buttons.

Possible Enhancements
Add web server or API for remote access.

Implement data logging to SD card or cloud.

Add more sensors for water quality monitoring.

Optimize power consumption for battery-powered use.

Implement OTA (Over The Air) firmware updates.
